I am a member of the China Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). In 2019, I successfully obtained my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Xiamen University, under the supervision of Professor Yifeng Zeng (a Minjiang Scholar, Distinguished Professor, and PhD Supervisor at Xiamen University). My primary research interests during my doctoral studies were modeling and decision-making in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems.
From 2019 to 2020, I had the opportunity to conduct postdoctoral research in the Department of Computer Science at Teesside University in the UK. Following that, I served as a senior researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Northumbria University in the UK from 2020 to 2021.
In December 2021, I joined the School of Computer Science at Minnan Normal University as a Associate Professor. 
In 2022, I received multiple recognitions: I was honored as a high-level introduced talent in Zhangzhou City, awarded the Youth May Fourth Medal by Minnan Normal University, and also recognized as a provincial-level introduced talent by Fujian Province.
